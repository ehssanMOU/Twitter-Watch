# Summary Generator

Hello, thank you for considering my application. I have implemented all parts, except creating a front-end and deploying
my code. I am a fourth-year student in my last semester at Dalhousie University, NS, Canada. I apologize for not 
implementing a front-end and deploying my code as I am currently busy with my courses. However, I have implemented the 
AI part for generating the summary for each account. Also, my api keys for accessing twitter had a limit, so I could not
retrieve all the replies for each tweet. That is the reason for setting a limit for retrieving tweets. Otherwise, 
Twitter would ban me for sometime

## Installation

To use this application, please install the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following 
command:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

After installing the dependencies, you can access summaries for accounts from the following endpoint:

http://localhost:8000/accountDescription/<username>


Replace `<username>` with the screen name of the Twitter user you want to generate a summary for, without the 
'@' symbol.

other endpoints are :

http://localhost:8000/accounts

http://localhost:8000/sentiment

http://localhost:8000//audience/<twitterhandle>



## About Me

I would like to work in the field of Machine Learning and Data Analysis. Thank you for considering my application.
